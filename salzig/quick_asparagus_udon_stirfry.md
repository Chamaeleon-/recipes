- 14 oz udon noodles (pre-cooked)
- 8.5 oz green asparagus
- 1 carrot
- 2 scallions
- 1 clove garlic
- 0.5 lemon
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 tbsp agave nectar
- 4 tbsp soy sauce

Cut off the woody bottoms of the asparagus and cut the remaining pieces diagonally into bite sized pieces. Peel the carrot and cut into thin strips. Finely chop the garlic. Slice the white part of the scallion to fine rings and set aside the green part, thinly slicing them for garnishing. Juice the lemon.

In a heatproof bowl, cover the udons with boiling water. Let them soak for approx. 2 min. until they are loosened. Then drain and set aside or prepare according to package instructions. Heat oil in a large frying pan or wok over medium heat. Add garlic, white part of scallions, and asparagus. Stir-fry for approx. 3 min. over medium heat with chopsticks or a spoon. Then add carrots and continue stir-frying for approx. 3 more min.

Add the loosened udon noodles and stir-fry for approx. 3 min. Add butter, lemon juice, agave nectar, and soy sauce and mix everything well until it’s all coated with the sauce. Garnish with sesame seeds and green part of the scallion. Serve immediately.
