- 0.25 lb mixed ground meat
- 1 scallion
- 0.5 oz ginger
- 1 garlic
- 4 tbsp honey
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 cup jasmine rice
- 1 cup water
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- vegetable oil (for frying)

Preheat oven to 200°C/425°F. Thinly slice scallion, set some aside for garnish, then mince the remaining scallion. Peel ginger and garlic. For the glaze, add honey, most of the soy sauce, and rice vinegar to a small bowl. Grate over approx. ⅓ of the ginger and mix to combine.

Wash and rinse the rice in a fine sieve until the water runs clear, then transfer to a pot with a lid. Add water, cover with a lid, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and cook for approx. 10 min. After the cooking time, remove from heat, keeping covered, and set aside.

In the meantime, add ground meat to a large bowl along with scallions, toasted sesame oil, and remaining soy sauce. Use a fine grater to grate remaining ginger and garlic into the bowl. Mix gently until well combined. Then use your hands to roll the mixture into evenly sized meatballs about the size of a whole walnut and place them onto a baking sheet.

Transfer the meatballs to the preheated oven and bake at 200°C/425°F until cooked through, approx. 8 min., brushing with the honey-soy glaze halfway through. Then turn on the grill function of your oven, brush the meatballs with more glaze, and grill for approx. 3 min., or until the meatballs turn nicely brown on top. Remove from the oven and brush again with remaining glaze. Serve meatballs with rice and garnish with sliced scallion as desired. Enjoy!
