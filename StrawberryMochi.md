# Strawberry Mochi (Ichigo Daifuku)

*Japan, Dessert*

**6 Daifuku**

---

- *6* strawberries
- *150 g* red bean paste (anko)
- *100 g* Shiratamako (glutinous rice flour/sweet rice flour)
- *20 g* sugar (2 Tbsp)
- *150 ml* water
- potato/corn starch for dusting

----

Rinse, dry, and hull the strawberries. Divide anko into 6 same size balls. Anko gets sticky on your hands, so wash your hands and dry completely each time you make a ball.
Wrap the strawberries with anko. Leave the tip of the strawberry uncovered. Wash your hands and dry completely each time you wrap a strawberry with anko.
In a medium microwave-safe glass bowl, mix shiratamako and sugar with a whisk.

Using a silicone spatula, slowly add water in 3 parts and stir until the mixture has reached a thick consistency. Cover loosely with plastic wrap.

First, microwave 1 minute (for 1200W microwave). Mix well with a wet silicone spatula. The mixture is still whitish and floury.
For the second time, microwave 1 minute again, and mix well with the wet silicone spatula. Now it starts to resemble mochi, but there are still some floury parts.
For the last time, microwave only 30 seconds. Now the mochi mixture should look translucent.
Sift corn starch on the tray and put the mochi on top.

With silicone spatula or kitchen scraper, fold the mochi in half one time so it won’t be as sticky and then divide into 6 equal pieces.

Put some corn starch on your hands and flatten and expand each mochi into a 3” round or square. Then put the anko covered strawberry on top of it, with the tip facing down.

Start covering the strawberry from all sides and use your thumb to hold the mochi on top.

When all sides of mochi meet at the top, twist and close. Hold the mochi with both hands and form into nice round shape. Repeat the process for the remaining mochi.
