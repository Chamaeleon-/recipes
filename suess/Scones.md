**12 Scones**

---

- *236 ml* cake flour (not self-rising)
- *472ml* all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling and cutting
- *118 ml* sugar, plus more for sprinkling
- *2 teaspoons* baking powder
- *1/2 teaspoon* baking soda
- Salt
- *172 g* cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
- *290 ml* cold heavy cream, plus more for brushing
- *1/4 teaspoon* pure vanilla extract

---

Preheat oven to 190 degrees Celcius.
Sift together flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.
Cut in butter with a pastry blender or rub in with your fingers. (The largest pieces should be the size of small peas.)
With your fingertips, flatten butter pieces into small disks.
Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until butter is very firm, about 20 minutes.

Combine cream and vanilla in a small bowl, and stir into flour mixture with a wooden spoon until almost absorbed and dough just comes together.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface; roll out into an 8-by-10-inch rectangle.
With a short side facing you, fold rectangle into thirds, as you would a letter.
Rotate dough a quarter turn clockwise.
Repeat rolling out, folding, and rotating dough 2 more times.
With floured hands, pat out dough to a 1 1/4-inch thickness, and cut out as many rounds as possible with a floured 2 1/4-inch round biscuit cutter.
Gather scraps, reroll once, and cut out more rounds (you should have a total of 12).

Place scones 2 inches apart on parchment-lined baking sheets.
Brush tops with cream, and sprinkle with sugar.
Bake until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through.
Let cool on sheets. Serve warm or at room temperature.
