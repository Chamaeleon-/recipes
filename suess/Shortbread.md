**vegetarisch*

**20 biscuits**

---

- *150g* plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- *100g* butter, chilled and cubed
- *50g* caster sugar, plus 1 tbsp for sprinkling

---

Heat the oven 170C/150C fan/gas 3.
Put the flour, butter and sugar into a mixing bowl.
Use your hands to combine the ingredients until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs, then squeeze until it comes together as a dough.

On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to Â½ cm thick.
Cut the dough into fingers and place on a lined baking tray.
Use a fork to create imprints, then sprinkle with the remaining caster sugar.

Chill the dough in the fridge for 20 mins, then bake for 15-20 mins until golden brown.
Remove the shortbread fingers from the oven and leave to cool on the tray for 10 mins.
